# GASES (GUID As Someone Else's Service)
A stupid way to get a GUID that's actually a GUID

I wanna thank the academy and whoever wrote newguid.com

_NOTE: newguid.com is now defunct, so I've ported this to forums.asp.net_

This would use XML/HTML parsing libraries but I wrote it on my windows box and pip didn't want to compile things and I'm lazy
